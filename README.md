TeamSupport Features Demo
### NOTE: this is a a demo. I added two random videos to the "Customer Management" and "Ticket Management" tabs to demonstrate the functionality.

## Using the Demo:
After downloading or cloning the repository, unzip the zip file and run index.html. Index.html mimics tutorial.html embeded inside of a website.

##Customizing the Demo:
Adding a video to the videos folder named <b>"intro.mp4"</b> will use the video as the starting video for the demo.

If you wish to add a new feature:
in "index.html" modify the <b>&lt;div id="menu"&gt;</b> to include the new feature.
For example: if I wanted to add the feature "New Feature" I would add:
<b>&lt;div class="stacker"&gt;New Feature&lt;/div&gt;</b>
to <b>&lt;div id="menu"&gt;</b>

I would also add a video to the videos folder named "New Feature.mp4". <b>NOTE: THE VIDEO NAME AND THE FEATURE NAME MUST BE THE SAME</b>
